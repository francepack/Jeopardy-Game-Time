- Opportunity to learn object oriented programming. 
- Create a 'pretty cool' finished product we are happy to share with others! 
- Full functionality and test coverage is the team goal.
- Practice using git and github, become more familiar with them.
- Refine our workflow as a team - commit and push changes frequently to keep both team members up to date on changes.
  
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Parin: both have the Imaginative-Inspirational and Lover of Transcendence qualities, so we both be able to look at the bigger picture of the project and how the user will interact with the game. We won't be at a loss for ideas and creative solutions to problems.

- Balance working on project solo and together - practice struggling solo.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Learn OOP
- Gain git and github proficiency
- Learn testing
- Learn how to implement a more advanced file structure in a project
- Practice using new/different prototype methods to solve a problem efficiently
- Work on incorporating project planning/sprints and sharing responsiblities to complete code

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- TBD

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
- Make sure we are commiting and pushing changes frequently to stay on the same page
- DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUESTS or push to master
- Make sure to work on one feature/piece of code at a time so PRs are for one thing

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- Keep an open line of communication
- Have frequent (daily) retros on how we are both doing with the project

Project management tools we will use:
- Waffle

Day 1 Agenda:
- DTR
